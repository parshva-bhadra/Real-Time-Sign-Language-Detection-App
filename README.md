# Real-Time-Sign-Language-Detection-App
Leveraged a keypoint detection model to build a sequence of keypoints which can then be passed to an action detection model to decode sign language. Built an end-to-end custom object detection model that allows you to translate sign language in real time. Deployed the model using React and Tensorflow.JS Computer Vision Template.

Install Tensorflow folder in the main directory before running the code.
